# quadruped-simulink

Following repo is built and tested on MATLAB R2019b

v1.0- Basic Model has correct kinematics and frames

Refined dynamics and control will be added later

Simscape Multibody simulation of a spider quadruped with 12 DOF

Run the startup_sm_ssci.m inside Libraries directory to initialise simscape multibody multiphysics library

After cloning run the Quadruped_1.slx file

Required Add ons in MATLAB R2019b are Simulink,Simscape,Simscape Multibody

## Algorithm (not tested)

Dijkstra path planning and a map for it work on

Fastslam 2 for localisation
